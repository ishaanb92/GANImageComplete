    "# Quality Metrics for Generative Models\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Author : Ishaan Bhat \n",
    "\n",
    "This document serves as a usage guide for the code developed to test various similarity metrics for images generated using the [Semantic In-paining technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/1607.07539). This method relies on a trained (on a certain dataset) Generative Adversarial Network, using which in-paininting for masked/incomplete can be performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the code repository into the local system\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a new directory on your local machine/server account\n",
    "* Use 'git init' to initialize the repository\n",
    "* Add a pointer to the remote repository using : 'git remote add origin https://github.com/kilgore92/GANImageComplete.git'\n",
    "* Pull the files from the remote repository using: 'git pull origin master'\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these steps, the setup to run the training/other experiments is now done.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the following steps illustrated in the further sections need to be performed:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train the DCGAN (optional)\n",
    "* Create the test data set\n",
    "* Run the completion script\n",
    "* Generate metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Training the DCGAN\n",
    "\n",
    "The train_dcgan.py script is used to launch the GAN training. This script instances the DCGAN class (defined in model.py) and takes a \"--dataset\" argument which should be a pointer to the training dataset folder. Currently it is located at /home/ibhat/image_completion/dcgan-completion.tensorflow/data/celebA folder on the grill server (grill.win.tue.nl). The training runs for 25 epochs and takes around 10 hours to complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The repository already has a \"checkpoint\" folder (which stores the trained model parameters) that can be used directly for further tasks, thus avoiding the need to re-train the model. To re-train the model, please remove this \"checkpoint\" folder before running the train_dcgan.py script.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a test dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The test data set is basically a sub-set of the training images chosen at random, which are masked and in-painted later. A script called create_test_set.py has been created that takes the argument --num_samples and chooses those many images from the training data folder randomly. These chosen images are then dumped into a generated folder called \"test_set\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running the completion code\n",
    "\n",
    "The complete.py script reads images from a folder (supplied by the user) applies masks to it (can be configured by the user) and feeds it to the DCGAN instance for completion. The location of the test set folder can be supplied through the argument '--imgs', although the default is set to the 'test_set' folder generated by the create_test_set.py script. This takes a lot of user arguments, all of which are optional. For a complete list, please use 'python complete.py -h' or 'python complete.py --help'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The complete.py script generates a folder called 'completions' which contains a sub-folders, each sub-folder stores progression of completion for each test image i.e. each different (numbered) sub-folder pertains to a different image from the test dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Eg: If there are 100 images in the test data set, there will 100 different sub-folders numbered from 0000 to 0099.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The metrics.py takes 2 arguments, \"--images\" which is the location of the folder that is generated by the complete.py and \"--num_images\" which is the number of images in the test-set. It uses the structured folder tree to calculate similarity metrics between each test image (ground truth) and its various iterations of completions. It does so for each test image and generates graphs where the Y-axis is the 'Similarity Metric' and the X-axis is 'Iteration number'. These graphs are generated for each test image and dumped into the \"results\" folder. The graph pertaining to sample \"before_XXXX.jpg\" will be saved as \"res_XXXX.png\" in the \"results\" folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently the metrics.py supports computation of the SIFT similarity metric. However, functionality to compute metrics such as PSNR, MSE etc can be added."
